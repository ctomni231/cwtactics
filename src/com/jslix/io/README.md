# JSON Library - Rundown

"JSON is so simple, does it really need a run down? Yea, don't answer that question."

A slight detour since JavaScript pretty much has JSON nailed down tightly. Adding a bunch of functions to this class that will hopefully make the Java side a little easier to wield. There isn't too much to add here, but I want to get this done before testing the image character text stuff. If I think of anything else, I'll list it here, but this README is probably going to be cut once everything JSON is figured out.

## To-Do

### JavaScript

- [x] A function that'll get all the elements of JSON into an array

### Java

- [x] A function that'll get all the elements of JSON into an array
