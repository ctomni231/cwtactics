This is the place where artwork from various archives are collected, just in case the original hosters go down. I really did hope that I would never have to use this place, but, it is what it is I guess. If the content becomes too heavy, it will be separated into its own branch in the future to relieve clutter from the main branch.

Black Hole HQ

The archive folder contains all the artwork that was hosted on advancewars.net. Plenty of CO sprites, animations, and AW artwork is now stored on this webpage.

Advance Wars Network 
---------------------

As a token of appreciation for reaching 25,000 page views. Here is a dump of all the data we managed to save from Advance Wars Network. A great site with a lot of good memories, and one of the places that helped build this team and keep Advance Wars alive.

A long time fan and contributor to the series. Devoted to writing a campaign and to preserving as much of the Advance Wars lore as he can. This is the collection of items he has pulled for the Custom Wars Tactics team.

Advance Wars By Web - Map Extractor
------------------------------------

For the 50,000 mark, this section will hold a java program for extraction of AWBW maps from the
server. This should allow normal users to collect the maps in a format that will be useable to
CWT in the future.
