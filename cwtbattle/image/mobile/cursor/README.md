# About the Custom Wars Tactics Cursor Icons

This folder holds the cursor animations for each cursor. They follow the exact same color format as Units, to allow for recoloring for each individual army. 

## Designer Notes (JSRulz)

There are 12 animations for each cursor to allow for custom designed cursors. Currently, there is only one design planned for the cursor look to keep things simple. This is probably very certain to change in the future as different layouts for the cursor may be requested.

The cursor designs are loosely based of off the original AW designs and old CW designs for familiarity reasons. I tried to allow room for different animations depanding on the situation (like idle, attacking, deleting, and building units). 

My goal was to make it possible to have custom cursors for each situation.

## Cursor Convention (Under COnstruction)

* **Animations (0 - 2)** - Idle
* **Animations (3 - 5)** - Attacking
