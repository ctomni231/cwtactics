# Quick Readme: About the Object_Stream Folder.

## Intro

This folder holds the firing animations for weapons which effects repeat over more than one tile. The classification for thiese types of weapons are "stream" weapons. A great example of this would be a laser weapon that hits all units in a straight line.

## About the Streaming Animations

Each stream animation covers 2 tiles in the current direction. When placing the animation, display the animation every other tile. 

All animations on the stream folder are meant to exactly match the animation position their firing counterparts. This means the animation position of the fire and the animation position of the stream it produces is going to be the same for each animation.

Each animation is designed to play from left-to-right once in that order. The timing between each animation is completely up to the discretion of the animator.

*Each artwork has a 16 pixel buffer on the top end of the image.
